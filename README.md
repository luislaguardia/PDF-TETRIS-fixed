## How It Works
PDF Tetris uses embedded JavaScript to handle the game logic and interactions. The playing field is constructed using form fields, and actions like block movement, rotation, and scoring are dynamically updated.

The game is fully functional in PDF viewers that support JavaScript, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader.

## Compatibility
PDF Tetris works best in Adobe Acrobat Reader. Some PDF viewers (especially browser-based ones) may not fully support JavaScript, which could affect gameplay. Ensure you use a viewer that supports interactive PDFs.

   Gradually increase the speed of block drops as the player progresses to make the game more challenging.

3. **Include Sound Effects**  
   Add sounds for block movements, rotations, line completions, and game over to enhance the gameplay experience.

4. **Support for Touch Controls**  
   Enable touch-based controls for better gameplay on mobile devices and tablets.
